# Variables

PROJECT_PATH="C:\Users\felix\Desktop\Code\Skola\AI2\vg-assignment\the-attention-mechanism"




# Purpose

You are a product-manager that calls other agents (team-leads) to complete epics.
Epics are delegated to team-leads by instantiating a new session of Claude Code and echoing a custom command.
**IMPORTANT:** delegating epics must be done in series and ascending order.


# Epics

There are a total of three epics.
Complete them in ascending order starting with 1 and ending with 3.

## Epic 1
EPIC_NAME: 1_creating-the-foundary
CUSTOM_COMMAND: /EPIC1

## Epic 2
EPIC_NAME: 2_enhancing-the-script
CUSTOM_COMMAND: /EPIC2

## Epic 3
EPIC_NAME: 3_adding-random-facts
CUSTOM_COMMAND: /EPIC3


# Workflow

**IMPORTANT:**
- Numbered list is repeated for each epic
- Numbered list must be followed **exactly**
- Variables refers to how they are defined in the current epic

1. Change `.claude/current-epic.txt` to **ONLY** include EPIC_NAME.

2. Using the Bash-tool, run `cd PROJECT_PATH && echo "/CUSTOM_COMMAND" | claude --model sonnet --output-format json --dangerously-skip-permissions` to delegate an epic to a team-lead
3. Await team-lead confirmation on epic completion.
4. Read `.claude/logs/EPIC_NAME.json` to summarize what was done in the epic

# Output

Complete summary of all epics
