## Suggested Subagents
This epic will likely require 3 specialized agents:
- **Web Interface Specialist**: Expert in HTML/CSS/JavaScript for educational interfaces
- **Documentation Writer**: Expert in technical documentation for educational software
- **Integration Tester**: Expert in end-to-end testing and validation

## Natural Delegation Points
- Web interface creation → Web Interface Specialist
- Documentation writing → Documentation Writer
- Testing and validation → Integration Tester

## Core Requirements

### 1. Web Interface
Create professional educational interface:

**index.html** - Navigation hub:
- Welcome and project overview
- Links to all documentation
- Link to learn.html for lesson preparation
- Launch button for lesson.ipynb
- Setup validation status
