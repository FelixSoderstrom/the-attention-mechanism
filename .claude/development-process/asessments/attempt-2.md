# Attempt 2

Failed in epic 3 due to connectivity issues.
Tried to resume where it left off but debugging took so long (background agents are not visible. Took way to long to figure out Anthropic was overloaded).

After resuming Epic 3 it finished within 4 tool-calls. This smells fishy so I decided to back off and try again tomorrow.

From logs I could see that subagents were created even though matching descriptions were available.
I therefore deleted all agents except for meta-agent.

I also moved team-lead specific instructions from claude.md (this was given to all subagents aswell) into the team-lead specific instructions (custom commands).

I deleted AI-assessment since this was for old and deprecated custom commands.
