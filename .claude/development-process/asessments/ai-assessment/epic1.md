I created a Claude project and attached these files.
- `.claude/commands/1_notebook-infrastructure.md`
- `.claude/commands/2_attention-mechanism.md`
- `.claude/commands/3_visualization.md`
- `.claude/commands/4_evaluation-grading.md`
- `.claude/commands/5_mini-transfoemer-integration.md`
- `.claude/commands/6_web-interface-documentation.md`
- `.claude/agents/meta-agent.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
I then gave sonnet this prompt:
```
Assume you were the team-leader for 1_notebook-infrastructure.md, explain in great detail:
- How you would complete this task
- What subagents you would create for this epic
- How you would delegate work
- The prompts you would provide to each subagent

I want much details so that I can debug the instruction.
Do **not** give directions on how I should edit the instruction.
**Only** give descriptions on how you would complete the task as a team-lead.
```

This was the answer I got:
Looking at this Epic 1: Notebook Infrastructure task as a team-lead, I need to analyze the comprehensive requirements and delegate strategically. Let me break down exactly how I would approach this.
Initial Analysis and Planning
First, I'd read through the entire Epic 1 specification and identify that this is a complex infrastructure setup requiring multiple specialized skillsets:

Python environment and dependency management
Cross-platform shell scripting with hardware detection
Jupyter notebook structure and cell organization
JSON schema design for progress tracking
PyTorch and ML library integration
LLM configuration (Ollama/OpenAI setup)

The epic is substantial - it's not just "create a notebook" but rather "create an entire educational infrastructure that subsequent epics will depend on."
Subagent Creation Strategy
I would create these specialized subagents through meta-agent:
1. Environment Setup Specialist
Meta-agent prompt: "Create a subagent specialized in Python virtual environment setup, cross-platform shell scripting, and automated dependency management. This agent should excel at hardware detection (VRAM, RAM, CPU), package installation with error recovery, and creating robust setup scripts that work across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The agent should understand educational contexts where users may have limited technical expertise."
This agent would handle:

Creating requirements.txt with pinned versions
Writing setup_venv.sh with executable permissions
Implementing hardware detection and LLM provider selection
Building error recovery mechanisms

2. Educational Notebook Architect
Meta-agent prompt: "Create a subagent that specializes in designing educational Jupyter notebooks with pedagogical structure. This agent should understand learning progression, cell organization for teaching complex concepts, and creating scaffolded learning experiences. The agent should be expert in creating both student versions (with helpful TODOs) and reference implementations, ensuring consistent variable naming and integration points."
This agent would handle:

Designing the exact 20-cell structure specified
Creating the 4 core implementation cells (6, 9, 12, 15) with proper scaffolding
Ensuring visualization integration points are correctly positioned
Building both lesson.ipynb and complete_lesson.ipynb

3. Progress Tracking Systems Developer
Meta-agent prompt: "Create a subagent specialized in educational progress tracking systems, JSON schema design, and verification infrastructure. This agent should understand automated assessment needs, progress persistence across sessions, and integration with evaluation systems. The agent should excel at creating robust data structures for tracking student learning progression."
This agent would handle:

Creating the exact progress JSON schema required
Building verify.py foundation with proper function stubs
Designing the grade/ directory structure
Creating .llm_config.json structure

4. ML Infrastructure Specialist
Meta-agent prompt: "Create a subagent specialized in PyTorch, transformers library, and educational ML infrastructure. This agent should understand tensor operations, attention mechanisms (for context), model loading, and creating educational scaffolding around complex ML concepts. The agent should focus on infrastructure that enables learning rather than production deployment."
This agent would handle:

Creating empty but properly structured src/ modules
Ensuring PyTorch/transformers integration points
Setting up model caching infrastructure
Creating the foundation for attention mechanism teaching

Detailed Delegation Strategy
Phase 1: Foundation Setup
To Environment Setup Specialist:
"Create the complete environment setup infrastructure for an educational attention mechanism lesson. You must create:

A requirements.txt file with these exact pinned dependencies [I'd provide the specific versions from the tech stack]
A setup_venv.sh script that MUST have executable permissions immediately after creation. The script requirements:

Detect hardware: VRAM ≥8GB, RAM ≥8GB, CPU cores ≥4, disk space ≥4GB
Try Python commands in order: python3, python, py
If hardware sufficient: auto-install Ollama and pull llama3.1:8b
If insufficient: prompt for OpenAI API key with validation
Test all components and report status
Provide platform-specific error recovery


Create .llm_config.json with this exact structure: [provide the JSON schema]

The script must be fully tested - run ./setup_venv.sh and confirm it completes successfully. This is critical infrastructure that Epic 2-6 depend on. Focus on robustness and clear error messages for educational users."
Phase 2: Notebook Architecture
To Educational Notebook Architect:
"Design the complete notebook structure for teaching attention mechanisms through 4 core implementations. Create both lesson.ipynb and complete_lesson.ipynb following this exact specification:
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Exactly 20 cells total with this structure: [provide the exact cell sequence]
Implementation cells at positions 6, 9, 12, 15 ONLY
Cell 4 must set up PROMPT_EXAMPLE = 'The cat sat on the mat' with exactly 6 tokens
Each implementation cell must end with these exact variable names: [provide the variable list]

In lesson.ipynb: Implementation cells contain helpful TODO comments with hints
In complete_lesson.ipynb: Implementation cells are identical but will be filled by Epic 2
Visualization cells (7, 10, 13, 16) must:

Import from src/visualizations.py
Call exact function names: visualize_qkv_projections, etc.
Include try/except for graceful failure with helpful messages

Both notebooks must execute all non-implementation cells without errors. Test this before completion. The cell numbering is absolutely critical - Epic 2 will target these exact positions."
Phase 3: Progress Infrastructure
To Progress Tracking Systems Developer:
"Build the complete progress tracking and verification infrastructure with these exact specifications:

Create progress/lesson_progress.json with this EXACT schema: [provide complete JSON]

Use keys matching Epic 4's evaluation: cell_6_linear_projections, etc.
Initialize with default values shown


Implement verify.py with function stubs for the 4 implementation cells

Must be importable from notebook context
Each function returns: {'score': int, 'feedback': str, 'passed': bool}
Include the LessonVerifier class structure


Create grade/ directory structure for evaluation output: [provide structure]

This infrastructure enables Epic 4's automated evaluation. The schema keys MUST match exactly - Epic 4 will use these precise names for cell evaluation."
Phase 4: ML Module Foundation
To ML Infrastructure Specialist:
"Create the foundational Python modules that Epic 2-5 will complete. You must create these files in src/:

__init__.py - proper package initialization
visualizations.py - empty functions with exact signatures:

python   def visualize_qkv_projections(embeddings, query, key, value, tokens): pass
   def visualize_attention_scores(attention_scores, tokens): pass  
   def visualize_attention_weights(attention_weights, tokens): pass
   def visualize_attended_values(attended_values, attention_weights, tokens): pass

evaluation.py - function stubs for Epic 4's grading system
model_utils.py - function stubs for Epic 5's transformer integration

Each function must have proper docstrings explaining its purpose and expected parameters. Import structure must work correctly - test that from src.visualizations import visualize_qkv_projections succeeds. These are integration points that subsequent epics depend on."
Coordination and Validation Strategy
Sequential Dependencies
I would run these phases sequentially because:

Environment setup must work before notebooks can be tested
Notebook structure must exist before progress tracking can be integrated
Module stubs must exist before notebooks can import them

Integration Testing Commands
After each phase, I'd have agents run these validation commands:
bash# Phase 1 validation
./setup_venv.sh
source venv/bin/activate
pip list | grep -E "torch|jupyter|transformers"

# Phase 2 validation  
jupyter notebook --version
python -c "import jupyter; print('Jupyter imports successfully')"

# Phase 3 validation
python -c "from verify import LessonVerifier; print('verify.py imports')"
ls -la progress/lesson_progress.json

# Phase 4 validation
python -c "from src.visualizations import *; print('All visualization functions imported')"
Critical Checkpoints
Before marking Epic 1 complete, I would personally verify:

Run the full Pre-Completion Checklist from the specification
Execute ./setup_venv.sh on a fresh system
Open both notebooks and run all scaffold cells
Confirm all subsequent epic dependencies are in place

Final Integration Prompt
To all agents collectively: "Epic 1 creates the foundation that Epic 2-6 build upon. Your implementations must be:

Robust enough for educational users with limited technical experience
Precisely specified - Epic 2 targets exact cell positions and variable names
Cross-platform compatible with graceful error handling
Self-documenting with clear error messages and recovery guidance

Test your implementations thoroughly. Any failures in Epic 1 will cascade through all subsequent epics. This is automated development - no human will fix issues later."
This delegation strategy ensures each specialist focuses on their expertise while maintaining the precise integration points that subsequent epics require. The key is being extremely specific about requirements while letting each agent determine the best implementation approach within their domain.
