I created a Claude project and attached these files.
- `.claude/commands/1_notebook-infrastructure.md`
- `.claude/commands/2_attention-mechanism.md`
- `.claude/commands/3_visualization.md`
- `.claude/commands/4_evaluation-grading.md`
- `.claude/commands/5_mini-transfoemer-integration.md`
- `.claude/commands/6_web-interface-documentation.md`
- `.claude/agents/meta-agent.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
I then gave sonnet this prompt:
```
Assume you were the team-leader for 6_web-interface-documentation, explain in great detail:
- How you would complete this task
- What subagents you would create for this epic
- How you would delegate work
- The prompts you would provide to each subagent

I want much details so that I can debug the instruction.
Do **not** give directions on how I should edit the instruction.
**Only** give descriptions on how you would complete the task as a team-lead.
```

This was the answer I got:
As the team-lead for Epic 6: Web Interface & Documentation, I would approach this systematically by first analyzing the requirements and then creating specialized subagents to handle different aspects of this complex epic. Here's my detailed approach:
Initial Analysis and Planning
First, I would read all the prerequisite completion files (.epic1_complete.json through .epic5_complete.json) to understand the current state and gather critical information about:

Notebook structure and cell positions
LLM configuration details
Visualization function names
Evaluation system structure
Model integration components

I would then break down Epic 6 into distinct domains requiring specialized expertise:
Subagents I Would Create
1. Educational Web Interface Specialist
I would use the meta-agent to create this specialist for building the HTML pages and JavaScript functionality.
My prompt to meta-agent:
Create a subagent specialized in building educational web interfaces with professional presentation standards. The agent should focus on creating clean, accessible HTML/CSS/JavaScript interfaces for educational content. Use this when we need to build index.html, learn.html, or any web-based user interfaces. The agent should understand WCAG 2.1 compliance, professional educational design principles, and offline-first approaches.
2. Technical Documentation Writer
I would create this agent for handling all the markdown documentation files.
My prompt to meta-agent:
Create a subagent specialized in technical documentation writing for educational software projects. This agent should excel at creating clear, comprehensive documentation including installation guides, troubleshooting, and technical specifications. Use this for creating INSTALL.md, CONFIGURATION.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, TECHNICAL_SPECS.md, and EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md files. The agent should understand both technical accuracy and educational clarity.
3. Integration Testing Specialist
For validating that all previous epics work together correctly.
My prompt to meta-agent:
Create a subagent specialized in end-to-end integration testing for educational software projects. This agent should focus on validating that complex multi-epic systems work together seamlessly, including cross-platform testing, error scenario validation, and user experience flow testing. Use this when we need to verify that all components from previous development epics integrate properly.
4. Educational Content Curator
For creating the learn.html educational content.
My prompt to meta-agent:
Create a subagent specialized in educational content curation and presentation for technical concepts. This agent should excel at explaining complex technical topics like transformer attention mechanisms in an accessible way, with proper attribution for external resources. Use this for creating comprehensive educational content that bridges theory and practice.
Delegation Strategy and Detailed Prompts
Phase 1: Foundation Validation and Planning
To Integration Testing Specialist:
Your first critical task is to validate that all previous epics are complete and functional. This is Epic 6 which depends on ALL previous work.

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Check for existence of .epic1_complete.json through .epic5_complete.json files
2. If ANY completion file is missing, STOP immediately and report the error
3. Read each completion file and extract key information:
   - From epic1: notebook structure, cell positions, LLM config, visualization function names
   - From epic2: implementation cells (6,9,12,15), output shapes, test phrase
   - From epic3: visualization functions implemented
   - From epic4: evaluation system structure, progress schema
   - From epic5: model integration components, new cells added

4. Perform basic functionality checks:
   - Can both notebooks open without errors?
   - Do the setup scripts exist and have proper permissions?
   - Are all src/ modules importable?
   - Does the progress tracking JSON exist with correct schema?

5. Document current system state for other agents

DELIVERABLE: Comprehensive status report confirming all dependencies are met, or clear error report if any epic is incomplete.

Coordination and Quality Control
Throughout this process, I would:

Monitor Progress: Regularly check in with each agent to ensure they're meeting requirements and deadlines.
Facilitate Integration: Ensure agents share necessary information (like the status report from the integration specialist informing the other agents).
Quality Control: Review each deliverable against the epic requirements before approving.
Handle Dependencies: Ensure the web interface specialist waits for content from the curator and documentation from the writer before final integration.
Final Validation: Before marking the epic complete, I would personally verify:

All required files are created
The complete user journey works end-to-end
Professional quality meets educational standards
Integration testing passes all scenarios



This approach leverages specialized expertise while maintaining clear coordination and quality control as the team lead.
