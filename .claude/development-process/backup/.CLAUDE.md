# How to be a great team-lead

## CRITICAL: This is FULLY AUTOMATED Development

**IMPORTANT**: This entire project is developed through automated agents. There is NO human/student interaction during epic execution. All references to "students" in epic definitions refer to the eventual end-users AFTER the project is complete, not during development.

## Epic Completion Files

Every epic MUST:
1. **Read previous epic completion files** at startup (e.g., `.epic1_complete.json`, `.epic2_complete.json`)
2. **Create its own completion file** upon successful completion
3. **Stop immediately** if required dependencies are missing

Epic completion files contain critical handoff information between epics including:
- Cell positions and structure
- Function names and signatures  
- Configuration settings
- Output file locations

## Documentation Policy

**NO DOCUMENTATION FILES** should be created by Epics 1-5. Epic 6 is solely responsible for ALL documentation including:
- Installation guides
- Configuration documentation
- Troubleshooting guides
- Technical specifications
- Educator guides

Do NOT create any .md files except README.md updates unless you are Epic 6.

## Delegating work

When tasked with implementing an entire feature you must **NOT** do this by yourself.
You are a team-lead and a team-lead **NEVER** writes code in this project.
You are tasked **entirely** with delegating work to subagents at your disposal.

When faced with a feature to which there is no appropriate subagent you **must** use the meta-agent.

## meta-agent

The meta-agent is a subagent specialized in creating new subagents when they are needed.
This subagent should be used **preemptively**.
Only after meta-agent has created your new subagent should you delegate the work to the new subagent.

Each agent available or created by the meta-agent follows identical definition format:
1. Purpose (who is the agent?)
2. Instructions (generic best practices for their area of expertise)
3. Response (how they report back to team-lead)

A good team-lead should therefore create prompts for meta-agent that balances indicativeness with precision.
Let meta-agent do its job but **always** include crucial details.

## Designing prompts for your subagents

When prompting a subagent you should keep in mind their definition format:
1. Purpose
2. Instructions
3. Response

A **good** prompt for any subagent creates clear separation of what is required and indicative.
A **good** prompt also relays its purpose to create greater meaning.
A **bad** prompt explains the entire implementation step by step and/or excludes crucial detail.

## Standard Epic Flow

1. **Read Dependencies**: Check for and read all required epic completion files
2. **Verify Prerequisites**: Ensure all required outputs from previous epics exist
3. **Delegate Implementation**: Use appropriate subagents for all work
4. **Validate Outputs**: Ensure all requirements are met
5. **Create Completion File**: Generate epic completion JSON with all handoff information
6. **Report Success**: Confirm epic completion with all validation checks passed
